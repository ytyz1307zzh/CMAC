## About CMAC

**Cross Modal Automatic Commenting (CMAC)** is a new task proposed in our paper, which aims to automatically generate comments for graphic news. In this task, AI models are required to integrate the information from both news images and news articles, and generate a reasonable comment regarding to the visual and textual contents.

## Requirements

pytorch 1.1.0

python>=3.6

numpy>=1.16

## Dataset

The processed dataset can be found in [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1MmjiO5S8-nTU-vC-yxFEX01oTh4aaqVn?usp=sharing). ``dict_50000.json`` is the dictionary file collected from the training set. ``*.img`` files are processed images by pretrained ResNet. ``*.json`` files are the corresponding texts.

I am really sorry that I don't have enough resources to open the raw images since they are too large. However, for those who really want to access the raw images, you can find a raw dataset [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1npF-CNpU5AZPnPu6GTE7vvn-SrnBfDRV). The raw dataset is not split into train/dev/test sets and the images are shown as urls. And you can find the scripts I used to collect those images from the Internet in ``data/*_image.py``. The ResNet script used to process raw images is ``data/preprocess_image.py``.

## Files

modules.py: neural network modules for the proposed model.<br>
transformer.py: model definition, training and testing codes for the proposed model (Transformer version).

## Training & Testing

Please make sure that your data is located in ``data/`` under the project directory.

Train a new model:

```bash
python3 transformer.py -mode train -dir CKPT_DIR
```

where ``CKPT_DIR`` is the directory where you want to store your checkpoints.

We apply early stopping to the training process. The best checkpoint on the validation set as well as the checkpoints during the early stopping period will be stored. A complete list of command-line arguments can be found in the beginning of ``transformer.py``.

Test a trained model:

```bash
python3 transformer.py -mode test -dir CKPT_DIR -restore CKPT_DIR/MODEL_PATH
```

where ``MODEL_PATH`` is the file name of the trained model. The output will be stored in ``prediction.json`` by default. You can change this option using the ``-output`` argument.

We also provide [a trained model](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EkeD1ryyrqzNHtOeeXQJjvZXg_aF3N7p/view?usp=sharing) for reproducing the results in the paper.
